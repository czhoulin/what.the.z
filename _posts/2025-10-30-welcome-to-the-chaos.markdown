Thanks for stopping by. This is the starting line for my little corner of the internet—a place to drop some **random thoughts** that usually get lost in a notebook or shouted into the void.

If you stick around, you can expect a mix of:

* 🐛 Lessons learned (or failed to learn) in **software** development.
* 👾 Reflections on tech **culture** and how we build things.
* ✨ Musings on life, balance, and the pleasant (or not-so-pleasant) **chaos** that surrounds it all.

No deep philosophy or strict schedule here, just a space to share, reflect, and maybe spark a good conversation.

Let's see where this goes. 
¡Nos vemos!
